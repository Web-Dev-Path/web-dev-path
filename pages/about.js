              The Web Dev Path project was idealized in 2020 in consequence of
              many conversations with aspirant web developers as well as by
              considering some personal experiences.
              <br />
              <br />
              When talking to other junior developers, it was evident the lack
              of practical experience with version control in a team dynamic was
              making their integration in a professional environment harder.

              Most of those new graduates used a version control feature, such
              as&nbsp;
              <a
                target='_blank'
                href='http://www.github.com'

              , as a repository for their personal projects where they were the
              only participants. So, all that “branch out and PR review”
              enriching process was completely unknown to them.
              <br />
              <br />
              That happened to be a problem either for being considered for
              “junior” positions and after being hired because, in most cases,
              their team lead was a very, very busy senior developer…

            <div>
              Another problem found out is that collaborating with open-source
              projects, the way it is possible to gain some version control
              experience, can be quite intimidating since there isn’t a clear
              mentoring aspect.
              <br />
              <br />
              It can take years for someone to develop “a logic mindset” that
              allows solving a problem by using a programming language, so just
              going to an open-source project with a list of available tasks
              that don’t make any sense won’t cut it.

              The ultimate purpose is to make this platform a portal where
              Non-Profit Organizations can find support for their web products.
              That way, new graduates can gain experience while helping a good
              cause.
              <br />
              <br />
              To do so, we're coding this platform in Next.js. In the short
              term, we intend to have a blog where the participants can post
              anything related to the web development world.
