Previously I worked at a food delivery company, and I was a menu care programmer who took care of building menus for restaurants with the companyâ€™s menu builder software. Sometimes I needed to do data entry for liquor vendors. They had more than 500 items. I needed to put more information on the menu like volume, quantities, ABV, bottle deposit, and so on from Excel sheets. It required a lot of energy. At some point, I thought these manual tasks might be scripted by programming. It made me interested in programming, and I started learning programming with online resources. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003e\n  \u003ca name="phase-i-online-learning" href="#phase-i-online-learning"\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  Phase I: Online Learning\n\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are so many free online learning resources nowadays.

Many people say that they cannot believe those courses are free. I cannot agree enough with that. I took CS50x,CS50P,CS50W, and CS50AI. It might be challenging to start with CS50x as a beginner, but the instructor is enthusiastic and engaging and their coding challenges are unique and interesting. It\'s always good to know the fundamental concept of computer science to be a better developer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes they ask you to make a video to show your project, I feel it\'s handy to showcase your projects if you are not planning to deploy them somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href="https://www.edx.org/cs50"\u003eCS50 Link\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\n  \u003ca name="the-odin-project" href="#the-odin-project"\u003e\n  \u003c/a\u003e\n  The Odin Project\n\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Odin Project equips you well to be a full-stack developer. You can choose JavaScript or Ruby on Rails after completing the foundation chapter. I chose the JavaScript path and learned a lot about React.js and Node.js. To follow this course, you need to read a lot. Sometimes it feels dry but reading is an essential skill for developers. Throughout the course, you need to make many projects. I recommend you check this out if you are interested in web development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey ask you to use Linux for following the course.
