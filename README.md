# Web Developer Path

The **Web Dev Path** project is an attempt to offer mentoring on how to work with a version-controlled project in a team environment. You can learn more about the project purpose and goals [here](https://github.com/Web-Dev-Path/web-dev-path/wiki).

Currently, we're developing [a platform](https://webdevpath.co/) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The platform will be a place where to share ideas about web development and where Non-Profit Organizations can get some help for their websites by sharing their project and needs and getting connected to volunteer junior web developers. This is [how](https://github.com/MarianaSouza/web-dev-path/projects/1) things are going on so far.

If you are a junior web developer looking for some guidance and mentoring, we invite you to join us and start coding our platform. You will learn how to code in a team environment by following [issue's](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) instructions and submitting your code to our repository through a [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) while guided throughout the entire process.

If you are an experienced and a patient-lovely developer, a true rockstar who wants to mentor juniors, it will be wonderful to have your help to review those PR's, write detailed issues and guide the developers when necessary.

Once in the project, you'll have access to our Slack channel where we get together and make things happen!
