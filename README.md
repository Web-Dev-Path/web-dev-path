# Web Developer Path

The **Web Dev Path** project is an attempt to offer mentoring on how to work with a version-controlled project in a team environment. You can learn more about the project purpose and goals [here](https://github.com/Web-Dev-Path/web-dev-path/wiki).

Currently, we're developing [a platform](https://webdevpath.co/) in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The platform will be a place where to share ideas about web development and where Non-Profit Organizations can get some help for their websites by sharing their project and needs and getting connected to volunteer junior web developers. This is [how](https://github.com/MarianaSouza/web-dev-path/projects/1) things are going on so far.

If you are a junior web developer looking for some guidance and mentoring, we invite you to join us and start coding our platform. You will learn how to code in a team environment by following [issue's](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) instructions and submitting your code to our repository through a [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) while guided throughout the entire process.

If you are an experienced and a patient-lovely developer, a true rockstar who wants to mentor juniors, it will be wonderful to have your help to review those PR's, write detailed issues and guide the developers when necessary.

## How to get started?

Please start watching carefully [our guideline tutorials](https://github.com/Web-Dev-Path/web-dev-path/wiki/Getting-Started). Then, if you think this is the right project for you, reach out by [email](mailto:hello@webdevpath.co) explaining why do you want to become a project collaborator. Once in the project, you'll have access to our Slack channel where we get together and make things happen!

<br />

## Quickstart

After talking to us by email, you'll be added to the project as a collaborator. That's when you'll be able to get your Pull Requests reviewed and merged.

This is how to get started locally:

- [Git clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)
- Ask on Slack for the `.env` file credentials with MailChimp and reCaptcha keys and add it to your local copy.
- Keep the `.env-template` file and create a `.env` file with the credentials
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn run dev` (for Windows)
- Run `yarn run dev-mac` (for macOS)
- [Branch out](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) by following the structure `feature/add-your-branch-name` or `chore/add-your-branch-name` or `fix/add-your-branch-name` and submit your [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

## Developer Note

- The Dev.to API has a limit of 1000 posts per response. If we exceed this limit by writing more than 1000 posts, we will need to update the getStaticProps on `/pages/blog`. For more details, refer to the [API documentation](https://developers.forem.com/api/v1#tag/articles/operation/getArticles).
