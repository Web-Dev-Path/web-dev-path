************************************ IMPORTANT *************************************************
RETURN the variable settings for /pages/api/contact.js
original:
const receiverEmail = 'hello@webdevpath.co';
const sendgridEmail = 'hello@webdevpath.co';



# Newsletter subscribe:
Contact page works fine with the solution BELOW (sending email + recording email + name on mailchimp )  
/components/ContactUsForm/index.js - line 85
if (data.Subscribe) {
    subscribe({ 
        EMAIL: data.Email,
        MERGE1: data.Name
    });
}

# Signup for news is not sending name to MC because <NewsletterSubscribe.js> is not receiving Name, only Email.
It is being fixed bu:
/components/mailchimp/NewsletterForm/index.js - line 73
const isFormValidated = onValidated({ 
    EMAIL: email,
    MERGE1: name
});


understand and practicing react-mailchimp-subscribe library better to suggest a solution with a unique component to handle the MailChimp API.




- SETUP/INTEGRATION
In order to get SendGrid working:
1- Create the sendgrid account
2- Generate API Key
3- Set .env accordingly
4- In SendGrid, it needs to execute the Single Sender Verification
https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/sender-verification
5- For test purposes, it is needed to change the code (pages/api/contact.js) to be adeherent with the sendgrid account (which is different from WebDevPath prod environment)
That means, ```sendgridEmail``` needs to be the same emails as the sendgrid account recently created for this test.
* ^ this code has to be returned for its original one before sending the Pull Request (PR).
